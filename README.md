# Wavefuntions of Nucleons in a Spherical Potential well
The above problem is taken due to the fact that it almost resembles the nucleons the way we observe in real world. The above code deals with solving bessel functions to find out the solutions of wavefunctions in a speherical potential well. Newton Rhapson method has been used to solve it. Due to computational limitations assumed values of l are taken to be max 2. The tolerace is taken to be in single decimal place. The values of l should be increased and tolearance should be taken around 1e-8 to get better results. 

Suggestions are welcomed and appreciated.
